# lease_manager
Work in progress

need to add an angular dialog to allow the staff to create a lot
the add leasee logic is bad, if we need to keep it, it will need to be modified to deal with each table seperately for data integrity, such as populating the lease holder into a pull down, similarly to the lot 

ability to change due and deliquent num days

see what is wrong with due date in detail page

add a feild in leaseholder table to see if customer wants payment reminder (bool)

add email client that sends a missing payment notication / payment reminder with default message(s), pulls leaseholders name, email, days/weeks/months late to build the body
