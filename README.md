# lease_manager
Work in progress

To launch the back end Django server install python, Django, django-cors-headers and other needed technologies. In the near future I plan to include a virtual enviroment.

To launch the front end, install node on your device, navigate to 'lease_manager\lease-manager' and run command "npm install" using powershell. the run the command ng serve to launch the front end Angular server.
